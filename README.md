# Image's pixels shower

This project is a simple program that shows the pixels of an image. It is written in Python and uses the OpenCV2 library.

I was searching for a application on the Internet that shows the pixels of an image, and I found nothing that can exactly fit my expectation. So I decided to make it.

For the sake of simplicity for displaying the pixels values, especially pixels in 16-bit depth maps, I am here to make this little program.

## How to use

It is easy to use. Just select your image path and run the program, and you will see the pixels values on the top of the image.
